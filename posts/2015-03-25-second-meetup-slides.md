Next meetup / future stuff
--------------------------

Our (next) April meetup will be again on the last Wednesday of the month, this
will be April 29th.

We already have one speaker scheduled, [Alexander
Gryzlov](https://twitter.com/clayrat) will talk about "Free monads" in
Scala(z).

There have been suggestions to do a session of lightning talks, so if you
are interested in dropping a 5-15 min lightning talk, contact us.
