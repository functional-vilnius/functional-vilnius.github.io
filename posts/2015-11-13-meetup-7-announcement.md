title: Functional Vilnius 7: It's F\# time!
author: Ignas
---

Hello functional people,

We are excited more than ever to announce our next meetup, because
we are lucky to have some Big Names on our speaker list
this time.


Speakers and talks
-----

Thanks to the [Build Stuff 2015](http://buildstuff.lt/) conference, many
software development experts are going to be in Vilnius next week. We have
managed to lure in some F\# enthusiasts speaking at Build Stuff to also come
enlighten us and give us a view of functional programming from their camp!


### [Rachel Reese](http://rachelree.se/), *Type Providers*

Our first speaker is Rachel Reese, who's among [other
things](http://rachelree.se/about/) a math geek, an F\# MVP and a big voice in
the F\# community.

She will introduce us to a very cool feature of F# called *Type Providers*,
which can be used to achieve type safety when interfacing with
external entities.


### [Phillip Trelford](http://trelford.com/), *Generative Art in F# and OCaml*

Phillip Trelford is a very early F\# adopter and advocate and the co-author
of [F\# Deep Dives](https://www.manning.com/books/f-sharp-deep-dives).

He will entertain us with a talk on generative art done functionally!
Expect some pretty pictures and elegant functional code.
