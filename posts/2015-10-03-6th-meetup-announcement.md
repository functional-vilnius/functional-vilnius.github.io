### "Golang from Scala developer's perspective" by [*Svetlana Bozhko*](https://twitter.com/sbozhko)

> Golang is becoming more and more popular. Most likely many of you have
> heard of its upgraded garbage collector and possibilities to work with
> lightweight threads -- goroutines. Obviously, Golang is quite a good choice for
> server-side software oriented on a huge load. As Scala backend developer, I am
> a big fan of functional programming and actor model. Golang seems very
> promising, but from the first glance, its a totally imperative language. In my
> speech I'm going to tell about my experiments with Golang and attempt to use it
> as a functional language.



### "A look through the lens" by [*Alex Gryzlov*](https://twitter.com/clayrat)

> What is bidirectional programming? Are lenses coalgebras or profunctors? Is any
> of this mumbo-jumbo remotely useful? Let's try to figure out together! 🐮
