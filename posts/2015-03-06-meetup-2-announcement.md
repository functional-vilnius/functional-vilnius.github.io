author: Ignas

Hi functionalists,

Guess what, we have another meetup ready for you. Sticking with our goals to
spread cross-community collaboration, this will be a joint meetup together with
[Vilnius JUG](http://vilnius-jug.lt/)!

* Date: *Wednesday, March 25, 19:00*
* Place: *Swedbank HQ, Konstitucijos pr. 20A (entry from the riverside)*
* Map: [https://goo.gl/maps/D7dm4](https://goo.gl/maps/D7dm4)

The date is 'the same' as last time -- last Wednesday of the month. We'll try to stick to this regular schedule from now on.

There will be two very exciting talks:

* *"Everything you wanted to know about monads, but were afraid to ask"*\
[Rolandas Gri≈°keviƒçius](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rolandasgriskevicius) (Swedbank / VGTU) will give a beginner friendly and very pragmatic introduction to the notorious things called monads. Expect some Ocaml, magic and even a bit of Java (7).
* *"Quest for composable immutable objects"*\
[Art≈´ras ≈†lajus](http://arturaz.net) (Tiny Lab Productions) will present how to compose objects from parts with inheritance in a purely functional world using Scala. Some advanced type hackery in this one, so be prepared. 

Read the full description and RSVP in the [meetup.com event](http://www.meetup.com/functional-vilnius/events/220941674/).

See you in a couple of weeks!
