## Speakers and talks

### *"Free Monads"*, [Alexander Gryzlov](https://twitter.com/clayrat), Adform

In the [previous meetup](2015-03-25-second-meetup-slides.html), Rolandas has
warmed you up with the monad introduction and now it's time for something more.
Alex will present the very cool concept of Free Monads in Scala.

For homework reading:

* Excellent blog post on the topic (though in Haskell):\

* Pretty much the same thing as above, but translated to Scala(z):\

### *"Living without Objects"*, [Osvaldas Grigas](http://www.ogrigas.eu/), Inventi

Abstract: "Transitioning from OOP to FP can be quite challenging, not least
because OO programmers are not used to thinking in terms of verbs instead of
nouns. Non-hybrid functional languages do not allow falling back to class
hierarchies, so one is forced to learn to think in terms of verbs and find
other ways of doing polymorphism and composition. We'll investigate some
examples of that in Clojure."
