<blockquote>
<p>Golang is becoming more and more popular. Most likely many of you have heard of its upgraded garbage collector and possibilities to work with lightweight threads ‚Äì goroutines. Obviously, Golang is quite a good choice for server-side software oriented on a huge load. As Scala backend developer, I am a big fan of functional programming and actor model. Golang seems very promising, but from the first glance, its a totally imperative language. In my speech I‚Äôm going to tell about my experiments with Golang and attempt to use it as a functional language.</p>

<p>What is bidirectional programming? Are lenses coalgebras or profunctors? Is any of this mumbo-jumbo remotely useful? Let‚Äôs try to figure out together! üêÆ</p>
