title: Announcing our Code of Conduct
author: Ignas

We sincerely wish to grow Functional Vilnius into an open and diverse community
where people with any kind of backgrounds can freely collaborate and discuss FP
ideas. In order to achieve this and ensure that our meetups are safe and
harassment-free, we have written up a [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct.html).

We ask you to read through it very careful and conform to the CoC rules in all
future meetups and online collaboration. Note that there will be no
exemptions to the CoC and we encourage you, as participants, to help
actively enforce the CoC alongside with the organizers.

If you have some suggestions on how to improve the Code of Conduct, we would
love to hear about it. Thanks for being a part of the community!
