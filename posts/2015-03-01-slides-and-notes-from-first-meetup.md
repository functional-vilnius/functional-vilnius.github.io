Thank you once again to everyone who attended our first meetup -- we had a
blast!

Here are the slides from the meetup:

* [Functional Programming: facts and myths](http://yfyf.github.io/talks/2015-02-25-functional-vilnius-talk/slides.html#/) by [Ignas Vyšniauskas](https://twitter.com/yfyf)
* [FP in Industry](http://vipo.github.io/industry-fp/) by [Viačeslav Pozdniakov](https://twitter.com/poznia), Adform

We are looking for speakers for the next meetup, so get in touch if
you want to talk about anything FP or type-driven development related.

Finally, if you want to host, sponsor or help with organizing the meetups then
we definitely want to hear from you.

P.S. We now also have a [LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Functional-Vilnius-6947548) -- join us there!
