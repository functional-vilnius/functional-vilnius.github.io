Next meetup
-----------

Next meetup is, as always, last Wednesday of the month, May 27th.\
We'll have two talks as usual:

#### *"Introduction to Rust"* by Nerijus Arlauskas ([\@nercury](https://twitter.com/nercury))

Rust 1.0 stable will be released on May 15th. To celebrate, Nerijus will give
you a brief introduction to Rust, explain its safe low level control mechanism,
type system, and some reasons it is easier to understand from functional point
of view.


#### *"Monoids and friends"* by Saulius Valatka ([\@saulius_vl](https://twitter.com/saulius_vl))

Saulius Valatka will continue our journey of exploring algebraic structures in programming.
This time, we hit the ubiquitous monoids. More info soon.
