We are hyped to announce our first meetup!

It will happen on February 25, 19:00, at [AdForm](http://adform.com/) offices, who
kindly volunteered to host this meeting.

There will be two talks:

* **"Functional Programming: facts and myths"** by [Ignas Vyšniauskas](https://twitter.com/yfyf)
* **"FP in Industry"** by [Viačeslav Pozdniakov](https://twitter.com/poznia), AdForm

We also plan to have a small discussion session afterwards to find out about your interests in FP and expectations of future meetups, so be sure to attend and let your opinion be known!
