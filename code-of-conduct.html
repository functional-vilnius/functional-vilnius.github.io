            <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

            <p>All attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, contributors and volunteers are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>Functional Vilnius events are for anyone interested in functional programming and type-driven development to discuss and share ideas in a fun, engaging and respectful environment.</p>
<p>The general rule is: <strong>Be empathic towards others, don’t be a jerk.</strong></p>
<p>We value the participation of each member of the community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the meet-ups and at all Functional Vilnius events and online interactions.</p>
<h2 id="what-it-means">What it means</h2>
<p>Functional Vilnius is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form.</p>
<p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meetup, including talks.</p>
<p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Functional Vilnius.</p>
<p>Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the meetup at the sole discretion of the organizers.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.</p>
<h2 id="need-help">Need help?</h2>
<p>If you are experiencing harassment or have concerns about our online content, please <a href="contacts.html">contact us</a>.</p>
<p>During the meetup events, any of the organisers will be able to help you.</p>
<h2 id="spelling-it-out">Spelling it out</h2>
<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>Contributors to the GitHub repository, the Meetup and/or event-related sites, sponsors, or similar are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.</p>
