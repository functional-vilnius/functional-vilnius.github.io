<p><em>Hi</em>,</p>
This is the website for Functional Vilnius meetups. It is in
construction, but you can already contribute by simply
<a href="https://github.com/functional-vilnius/functional-vilnius.github.io/fork">forking</a>
and making a pull-request on Github.

<p><em>We hope to organise the first meeting mid-February, keep your eyes and
ears open!</em></p>
