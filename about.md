**Functional Vilnius** is a meetup group for everyone interested in *functional
programming* and/or *type-driven* software development.

We aim to be a *polyglot* user group and are completely open-minded to
applications of these principles in any programming language (i.e. we are not
some Haskell-nazis). Our goal is to spread the adoption of ideas related to
functional programming in an approachable way and in as many different settings
as possible.

If you want to help with organisation, be a speaker or just say hi, [get in
touch](contact.html).
