<p>Thanks to everyone for making the 3rd Functional Vilnius meetup happen! It‚Äôs very exciting to see continued interest in FP ideas.</p>
<h2 id="slides">Slides</h2>
<p>Here are the slides from the last meetup</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/meetups/meetups/2015-04-29-functional-vilnius-03/freemonads.pdf">Free monads</a>, Alexander Gryzlov</li>
<li><a href="http://ogrigas.github.io/living-without-objects/">Living without Objects</a>, Osvaldas Grigas</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="survey">Survey</h2>
<p>Very-pretty-please fill-in our (short!) <a href="http://goo.gl/mvnkjK">survey</a>. This will help us improve the future meetups by understanding your background and expectations.</p>
<h2 id="next-meetup">Next meetup</h2>
<p>Next meetup is, as always, last Wednesday of the month, May 27th.<br />We‚Äôll have two talks as usual:</p>
<h4 id="introduction-to-rust-by-nerijus-arlauskas-nercury"><em>‚ÄúIntroduction to Rust‚Äù</em> by Nerijus Arlauskas (<a href="https://twitter.com/nercury">@nercury</a>)</h4>
<p>Rust 1.0 stable will be released on May 15th. To celebrate, Nerijus will give you a brief introduction to Rust, explain its safe low level control mechanism, type system, and some reasons it is easier to understand from functional point of view.</p>
<h4 id="monoids-and-friends-by-saulius-valatka-saulius_vl"><em>‚ÄúMonoids and friends‚Äù</em> by Saulius Valatka (<a href="https://twitter.com/saulius_vl">@saulius_vl</a>)</h4>
<p>Saulius Valatka will continue our journey of exploring algebraic structures in programming. This time, we hit the ubiquitous monoids. More info soon.</p>

<p>Hi friends,</p>
<p>The end of the month is near and so is our next meetup.</p>
<h2 id="date-and-venue">Date and venue</h2>
<ul>
<li>Date: <em>Wednesday, April 29, 19:00</em></li>
<li>Place: <em>Adform, 5th floor, J. Jasinskio g. 16C</em></li>
<li>Map: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/mAo0f" class="uri">https://goo.gl/maps/mAo0f</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-announcements">Some announcements</h2>
<ul>
<li>We <a href="2015-04-13-0-our-code-of-conduct.html">now have a Code of Conduct</a>, please read it and respect it.</li>
<li>We‚Äôll be handing out stickers, which look like this:<br /><img src="/img/stickers.jpg" alt="Ooh, fresh stickers" /></li>
<li>We have spots for some lightning talks. Want to give one? Write to us.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="speakers-and-talks">Speakers and talks</h2>
<h3 id="free-monads-alexander-gryzlov-adform"><em>‚ÄúFree Monads‚Äù</em>, <a href="https://twitter.com/clayrat">Alexander Gryzlov</a>, Adform</h3>
<p>In the <a href="2015-03-25-second-meetup-slides.html">previous meetup</a>, Rolandas has warmed you up with the monad introduction and now it‚Äôs time for something more. Alex will present the very cool concept of Free Monads in Scala.</p>
<p>For homework reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent blog post on the topic (though in Haskell):<br /> <a href="http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/you-could-have-invented-free-monads.html" class="uri">http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/you-could-have-invented-free-monads.html</a></li>
<li>Pretty much the same thing as above, but translated to Scala(z):<br /> <a href="http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/Free+Monad.html" class="uri">http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/Free+Monad.html</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="living-without-objects-osvaldas-grigas-inventi"><em>‚ÄúLiving without Objects‚Äù</em>, <a href="http://www.ogrigas.eu/">Osvaldas Grigas</a>, Inventi</h3>
<p>Abstract: ‚ÄúTransitioning from OOP to FP can be quite challenging, not least because OO programmers are not used to thinking in terms of verbs instead of nouns. Non-hybrid functional languages do not allow falling back to class hierarchies, so one is forced to learn to think in terms of verbs and find other ways of doing polymorphism and composition. We‚Äôll investigate some examples of that in Clojure.‚Äù</p>

    <title>Announcing our Code of Conduct</title>

<p>We sincerely wish to grow Functional Vilnius into an open and diverse community where people with any kind of backgrounds can freely collaborate and discuss FP ideas. In order to achieve this and ensure that our meetups are safe and harassment-free, we have written up a <a href="/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>We ask you to read through it very careful and conform to the CoC rules in all future meetups and online collaboration. Note that there will be no exemptions to the CoC and we encourage you, as participants, to help actively enforce the CoC alongside with the organizers.</p>
<p>If you have some suggestions on how to improve the Code of Conduct, we would love to hear about it. Thanks for being a part of the community!</p>

<p>Hi functionalists,</p>
<p>Guess what, we have another meetup ready for you. Sticking with our goals to spread cross-community collaboration, this will be a joint meetup together with <a href="http://vilnius-jug.lt/">Vilnius JUG</a>!</p>
<ul>
<li>Date: <em>Wednesday, March 25, 19:00</em></li>
<li>Place: <em>Swedbank HQ, Konstitucijos pr. 20A (entry from the riverside)</em></li>
<li>Map: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/D7dm4" class="uri">https://goo.gl/maps/D7dm4</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The date is ‚Äòthe same‚Äô as last time ‚Äì last Wednesday of the month. We‚Äôll try to stick to this regular schedule from now on.</p>
<p>There will be two very exciting talks:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>‚ÄúEverything you wanted to know about monads, but were afraid to ask‚Äù</em><br /><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rolandasgriskevicius">Rolandas Gri≈°keviƒçius</a> (Swedbank / VGTU) will give a beginner friendly and very pragmatic introduction to the notorious things called monads. Expect some Ocaml, magic and even a bit of Java (7).</li>
<li><em>‚ÄúQuest for composable immutable objects‚Äù</em><br /><a href="http://arturaz.net">Art≈´ras ≈†lajus</a> (Tiny Lab Productions) will present how to compose objects from parts with inheritance in a purely functional world using Scala. Some advanced type hackery in this one, so be prepared.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read the full description and RSVP in the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/functional-vilnius/events/220941674/">meetup.com event</a>.</p>
<p>See you in a couple of weeks!</p>
