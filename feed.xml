<p>Hello functional people,</p>
<p>We are excited more than ever to announce our next meetup, because we are lucky to have some Big Names on our speaker list this time.</p>
<h2 id="speakers-and-talks">Speakers and talks</h2>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://buildstuff.lt/">Build Stuff 2015</a> conference, many software development experts are going to be in Vilnius next week. We have managed to lure in some F# enthusiasts speaking at Build Stuff to also come enlighten us and give us a view of functional programming from their camp!</p>
<h3 id="rachel-reese-type-providers"><a href="http://rachelree.se/">Rachel Reese</a>, <em>Type Providers</em></h3>
<p>Our first speaker is Rachel Reese, who‚Äôs among <a href="http://rachelree.se/about/">other things</a> a math geek, an F# MVP and a big voice in the F# community.</p>
<p>She will introduce us to a very cool feature of F# called <em>Type Providers</em>, which can be used to achieve type safety when interfacing with external entities.</p>
<h3 id="phillip-trelford-generative-art-in-f-and-ocaml"><a href="http://trelford.com/">Phillip Trelford</a>, <em>Generative Art in F# and OCaml</em></h3>
<p>Phillip Trelford is a very early F# adopter and advocate and the co-author of <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/f-sharp-deep-dives">F# Deep Dives</a>.</p>
<p>He will entertain us with a talk on generative art done functionally! Expect some pretty pictures and elegant functional code.</p>
<h2 id="datelocation">Date/location</h2>
<p>Date: Thursday, November 19, 19:00</p>
<p>Location: VU MIF, Naugarduko g. 24, LT-03225 Vilnius<br />Map: <a href="https://www.google.lt/maps/place/Faculty+of+Mathematics+and+Informatics,+VU/@54.6750993,25.2716828,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x46dd946db549699f:0xc50ce545ac33a4ff?hl=en">here</a></p>
<p>Please RSVP <a href="http://www.meetup.com/functional-vilnius/events/226279175/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fby-ticket-lottery"><code>f(by)</code> ticket lottery</h2>
<p>Our <a href="http://dev.by/">friends in Belarus</a> are inviting us to join their first, international conference on Functional Programming ‚Äì <a href="http://fby.by/en/">f(by)</a>. It will happen on the 28th of November in Minsk, with a focus on Scala and Haskell.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs even more, they promised us a free ticket, that we are giving away to our community, so please come to the meetup for a chance to win one!</p>

<p>Hi functional people!</p>
<p>Hope you had a nice summer and your mind is clear, fresh and open for new ideas, because we return to drop some knowledge. We are very excited to invite you to our next meetup!</p>
<h2 id="datelocation">Date/location</h2>
<p>Date: Wednesday, October 21st.</p>
<p>Location: Adform (new) office, Sporto g. 18, Vilnius</p>
<p>Please RSVP <a href="http://www.meetup.com/functional-vilnius/events/223570957/">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Golang is becoming more and more popular. Most likely many of you have heard of its upgraded garbage collector and possibilities to work with lightweight threads ‚Äì goroutines. Obviously, Golang is quite a good choice for server-side software oriented on a huge load. As Scala backend developer, I am a big fan of functional programming and actor model. Golang seems very promising, but from the first glance, its a totally imperative language. In my speech I‚Äôm going to tell about my experiments with Golang and attempt to use it as a functional language.</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúIn this talk we will take a step back and focus on the simplest algebraic structures out there: monoids and their friends like semigroups etc. We will demonstrate how natural and ubiquitous they are in real life using tons of examples.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>Hi friends,</p>
<p>The end of the month is near and so is our next meetup.</p>
<h2 id="date-and-venue">Date and venue</h2>
<ul>
<li>Date: <em>Wednesday, April 29, 19:00</em></li>
<li>Place: <em>Adform, 5th floor, J. Jasinskio g. 16C</em></li>
<li>Map: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/mAo0f" class="uri">https://goo.gl/maps/mAo0f</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-announcements">Some announcements</h2>
<ul>
<li>We <a href="2015-04-13-0-our-code-of-conduct.html">now have a Code of Conduct</a>, please read it and respect it.</li>
<li>We‚Äôll be handing out stickers, which look like this:<br /><img src="/img/stickers.jpg" alt="Ooh, fresh stickers" /></li>
<li>We have spots for some lightning talks. Want to give one? Write to us.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="speakers-and-talks">Speakers and talks</h2>
<h3 id="free-monads-alexander-gryzlov-adform"><em>‚ÄúFree Monads‚Äù</em>, <a href="https://twitter.com/clayrat">Alexander Gryzlov</a>, Adform</h3>
<p>In the <a href="2015-03-25-second-meetup-slides.html">previous meetup</a>, Rolandas has warmed you up with the monad introduction and now it‚Äôs time for something more. Alex will present the very cool concept of Free Monads in Scala.</p>
<p>For homework reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent blog post on the topic (though in Haskell):<br /> <a href="http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/you-could-have-invented-free-monads.html" class="uri">http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/you-could-have-invented-free-monads.html</a></li>
<li>Pretty much the same thing as above, but translated to Scala(z):<br /> <a href="http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/Free+Monad.html" class="uri">http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/Free+Monad.html</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="living-without-objects-osvaldas-grigas-inventi"><em>‚ÄúLiving without Objects‚Äù</em>, <a href="http://www.ogrigas.eu/">Osvaldas Grigas</a>, Inventi</h3>
<p>Abstract: ‚ÄúTransitioning from OOP to FP can be quite challenging, not least because OO programmers are not used to thinking in terms of verbs instead of nouns. Non-hybrid functional languages do not allow falling back to class hierarchies, so one is forced to learn to think in terms of verbs and find other ways of doing polymorphism and composition. We‚Äôll investigate some examples of that in Clojure.‚Äù</p>

<p>We sincerely wish to grow Functional Vilnius into an open and diverse community where people with any kind of backgrounds can freely collaborate and discuss FP ideas. In order to achieve this and ensure that our meetups are safe and harassment-free, we have written up a <a href="/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>We ask you to read through it very careful and conform to the CoC rules in all future meetups and online collaboration. Note that there will be no exemptions to the CoC and we encourage you, as participants, to help actively enforce the CoC alongside with the organizers.</p>
<p>If you have some suggestions on how to improve the Code of Conduct, we would love to hear about it. Thanks for being a part of the community!</p>

<p>Hi functionalists,</p>
<p>Guess what, we have another meetup ready for you. Sticking with our goals to spread cross-community collaboration, this will be a joint meetup together with <a href="http://vilnius-jug.lt/">Vilnius JUG</a>!</p>
<ul>
<li>Date: <em>Wednesday, March 25, 19:00</em></li>
<li>Place: <em>Swedbank HQ, Konstitucijos pr. 20A (entry from the riverside)</em></li>
<li>Map: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/D7dm4" class="uri">https://goo.gl/maps/D7dm4</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The date is ‚Äòthe same‚Äô as last time ‚Äì last Wednesday of the month. We‚Äôll try to stick to this regular schedule from now on.</p>
<p>There will be two very exciting talks:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>‚ÄúEverything you wanted to know about monads, but were afraid to ask‚Äù</em><br /><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rolandasgriskevicius">Rolandas Gri≈°keviƒçius</a> (Swedbank / VGTU) will give a beginner friendly and very pragmatic introduction to the notorious things called monads. Expect some Ocaml, magic and even a bit of Java (7).</li>
<li><em>‚ÄúQuest for composable immutable objects‚Äù</em><br /><a href="http://arturaz.net">Art≈´ras ≈†lajus</a> (Tiny Lab Productions) will present how to compose objects from parts with inheritance in a purely functional world using Scala. Some advanced type hackery in this one, so be prepared.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read the full description and RSVP in the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/functional-vilnius/events/220941674/">meetup.com event</a>.</p>
<p>See you in a couple of weeks!</p>
